# Configuring Android Studio

## Use the Darcula Theme in Android Studio

Ok, I know its more like a preference, but trust me using that keeps your eyes less strained as they would be if you used the Default Light theme.

## Don't use a small font

Preferably use a font in Android Studio that's easy to read and is at a font size which does not forces you to strain your eyes. Also using fonts that support lingature increases readeablity. While everyone has a preferred font, below are some options for interested folks:

- [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

## Use a code style

You should use a standard codestyle, so possible contenders can be

- [AOSP Codestyle](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)
- [Square IntelliJ Codestyle](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles)
- [Grandcentrix Codestyle](https://github.com/grandcentrix/AndroidCodeStyle)
